This section focuses on:
- Learn the fundamentals of Python programming, including execptions and control flow
- Implement Python-based solutions to interact with hardware components such as sensors, motors, and relays.
- Develop IoT applications using libraries like paho-mqtt for MQTT protocol and network communication through TCP/UDP.
- Perform image processing tasks using Python libraries such as OpenCV to capture and analyze data from cameras.

### 2. Linux

Key topics covered include:
- Introduction to the Linux operating system and its architecture.
- Hands-on experience with Linux shell commands, file system management, process control, and user permissions.
- Understanding of system services, daemons, and the Linux kernel.
- Introduction to Linux networking, network interfaces, and system monitoring.
- Working with Linux-based tools such as gcc, gdb, and shell scripting for automation.

### 3. Modern C++

This section focuses on:
- Mastering the latest features of C++ (C++11/14/17 standards), including smart pointers, lambda expressions, and concurrency models.
- Developing efficient, real-time applications for embedded systems using Modern C++.
- Interfacing C++ code with hardware components and handling low-level memory management.
- STL (Standard Template Library): I leveraged the STL, including containers, iterators, and algorithms, to handle data structures and perform operations efficiently, especially in real-time environments.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): I applied OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction to structure embedded software projects efficiently.

### 4. Raspberry Pi

In the Raspberry Pi module, I learned:
- How to set up and configure Raspberry Pi, including installing the Linux OS, connecting it to Wi-Fi and Ethernet, and accessing it through various methods (e.g., keyboard, mouse, SSH, PuTTY, and VNC Viewer).
- Working with GPIO pins to control hardware like DC motors, servo motors, and stepper motors using PWM and motor drivers (e.g., H Bridge).
- Using the Raspberry Pi for IoT applications, focusing on TCP/UDP communication and MQTT protocol for publishing and subscribing to topics.
- Introduction to image processing tasks using Raspberry Pi and interfacing cameras to capture and process images in real-time.
- All the tasks in this section were implemented using both Python and Modern C++.
